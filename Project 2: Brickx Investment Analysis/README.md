# Project 2: Brickx Investment Analysis

The purpose of this project is to explore the changes in my investment portfolio in Brickx (a micro investment company for Australian properties). Through this analysis I aim to explore the concentration of my investments such as rental yield, investment in each state and correlation of unit price and rental income.

## About the dataset
The dataset was extracted from my personal transaction history using the microinvestment platform in property known as Brickx in late May 2023. The dataset was initially cleaned in SQLite with further exploration conducted in Python and later visualised in Tableau Public.
